## About
The FSIB Rasa Chatbot is an open-source project leveraging the Rasa framework to create a contextual AI assistant for banking services. It uses natural language understanding (NLU) and dialogue management to provide meaningful responses to user queries related to banking operations, such as checking account balances, transaction history, and customer support. The chatbot is designed to be scalable and customizable for integration with various platforms.

## Features
- **NLU Capabilities**: Understands user intents and entities for accurate query processing.
- **Custom Actions**: Supports API calls and database queries for dynamic responses (e.g., fetching account details).
- **Web Integration**: Includes a web widget for seamless deployment on websites using SocketIO.
- **Extensible**: Easily customizable for additional banking features or integration with other channels like Slack or Telegram.
